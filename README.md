This is the first version of my portfolio page.

## Updated portfolio

## Technologies used

### React 18.2

I utilized React to take advantage of its component-based approach to foster code reusability and efficient development.

### Typescript 4.9

TypeScript was employed in this project to enhance the development process by providing improved tooling and detecting potential errors during coding.

### Material UI 5.13.4

Its customizable components align with the Material Design guidelines, resulting in an intuitive and visually appealing UI.

### Github

In addition to serving as a version control system for my code, GitHub is also the platform used to deploy the portfolio website through GitHub Pages.
